# Smart Traffic Light System

A web-based simulation of an intelligent traffic management system that prioritizes emergency vehicles using graph algorithms. This project demonstrates how graph theory can be applied to optimize traffic flow and reduce response times for ambulances.

## Features

- **Interactive Traffic Network Visualization**: Visual representation of intersections, roads, traffic lights, and vehicles
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Automatic rerouting and traffic light optimization for ambulances
- **Real-time Simulation**: Dynamic traffic flow with adjustable simulation speed
- **Graph Algorithm Implementation**: Core routing logic implemented in C++
- **Control Panel**: Monitor and control traffic lights and emergency vehicles
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Architecture

The project consists of:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js React application for the user interface
2. **Simulation Engine**: JavaScript-based traffic simulation
3. **Graph Algorithm**: C++ implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and traffic optimization
4. **State Management**: React hooks for managing application state

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- A modern web browser
